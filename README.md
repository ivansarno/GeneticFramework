# GeneticFramework
Framework for Genetic Algorithm in F#

**This project is in the development stage**

The framework allows you to create complex functions that implements Genetic Algorithms,structured as a pipeline.
The framework provides several operators to build the pipeline, from pre-configured to those customizable at various levels of detail.

**The framework consists of:**  

	-Evolution Algorithms
	-Reproduction routines
	-Mutation operators
	-Selection operators
	-Crossover operators
	-Generic Utils
	
**Types and Encodings**  
The framework is independent of the problem encodings. It provides built-in support for:  

	-Integers: Mutators, Initializers and Utils
	
**Examples**  
Examples of use are available:   
	-Discrete Knapsack Problem
