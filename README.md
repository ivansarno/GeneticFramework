# GeneticFramework
Framework for genetic algorithm in Python

# This project is in the experimental stage

the framework is composed by:

-abstract genetic algorithms

-basic selection functions

-basic mutation operator for integers and bits sequences

-function to create complex mutator from basic mutation operators

-algoritms specific for integers and bits sequences

-random initializers specific for integers and bits sequences

-examples

Dependencies:

bitstring package
